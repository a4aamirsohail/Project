Insurance Premium Analysis – Power BI Dashboard
Hey there!
This project is a deep dive into how insurance premiums vary across age, gender, smoking habits, and regions. I built this interactive Power BI dashboard to practice real-world data analysis and improve my storytelling with data.

What’s inside?
A clean, interactive dashboard
Insights on how different factors affect insurance costs
Visual breakdowns for quick understanding

A separate “Key Takeaways” image that sums it all up at a glance


💡 Key Insights:
🔺 Premiums rise with age – peaking around age 50
🚬 Smokers pay 4x more than non-smokers on average
👩 Females contribute slightly more to total premiums than males
🗺️ East region shows the highest average premiums

🛠 Tools Used:

Power BI for visualization
DAX for measures
Excel for basic cleaning and prep

🤝 Why I Made This
As someone transitioning into data analytics, I wanted to apply what I’ve been learning to a relatable topic. The insurance domain felt like a perfect fit, especially with my background in claim settlement. This dashboard helped me connect data with decision-making in a meaningful way.
